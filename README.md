# Houry

As long as I decided to smoke 1 cigarette for an hour I created this app.
The main goal is to limit smoking. 
What this app can do? 
1) tap "smoke" button when you're going to smoke 
2) next time (according the app) you'll be able to smoke only in the next hour.
   For example in 16.00 in your last cigarette was in 15.12, or in 20.00 if your last cigarette was in 19.52 and so on.
